				<div class="panel-body"> Once shipped most domestic orders take anywhere from 1-3 business days, possibly longer depending on the efficiency of your local postal service. For pre-orders, it may take longer, as we wait to hit a quota before we place the orders with our supplier. </div>

			<div id="panel-six" class="panel-collapse collapse">
				<div class="panel-body"> For pre-ordered items, we estimate the time of placement to the time of arrival to be roughly around 2 weeks. For pre-ordered items, we place the order into production when we hit a quota, so the estimated time of arrival may fluctuate depending on how quickly that minimum number of orders is met. We thank you for your patience! </div>
