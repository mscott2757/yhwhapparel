	   YHWH was created out of a love made known, a need that was seen, and a call that was heard (Psalm 107).
	   YHWH is the tetragrammaton of one of the names of God, often spoken as "Yahweh" (Exodus 3:14). It was (and still is, by certain groups) regarded too holy to be spoken.

			<p>Our desire is simply to share the goodness and truth of the Gospel. To tell the world of the beautiful name of God that they may seek and find that He is Lord and that they may discover the unconditional love that is for them.</p>
			<p>Our vision is to speak truth through our apparel, empowering people to express their identity as children of the Most High King, and to encourage believers to be bold as they carry the name of their Lord, not only on their shirts, but on their hearts. It is also a call to live a life of consistency before our God.</p>

						<p>Serena is in her second year of UC Berkeley, majoring in Business Administration and minoring in Education. She loves to play basketball, eat cake, and wiggle to the beat of music, because she’s more of a wiggler than a coordinated dancer. She likes to watch The Office, We Bare Bears, NBA [Shout out to GSW &amp; Jeremy Lin] and the sunset. She hopes that God will use YHWH for His glory, to ignite a movement in Berkeley that exposes God's love for His people. She finds her identity solely a child of God. (2 Corinthians 5:17)</p>
