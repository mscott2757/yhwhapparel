	<h3>Missions</h3>
	<p> In the book of Matthew, Jesus commands us to go and make disciples of all nations.
			More than simply through the clothing we wear or produce, YHWH Apparel wants
			to take up this call in action alongside the rest of the Church. And YOU are
			the Church! As you labor for the Lord, we want to partner with
			you and support you in the specific mission God has given you. As you are
			faithful to your part, we also want to be faithful with what God has given us. </p>
	<p> If you are going on a mission trip and are interested or simply just want a prayer
			partner, please fill out the

				<p> The trip will mainly consist of serving with the local missionary that
					has been in the tribe reservation for 18 years and also the local church in
					the reservation. We will be helping to spread the gospel through VBS for the
					children and also in street evangelism. We will be focusing on many
					children that are often raised by single parents or grandparents because
					either one or both members of their parents take government funding and
					spend it gambling. </p>
				<span class="read-more-target">
					<p> Prayer Requests: </p>
					<p> 1. Team - Please pray for safety (physical, spiritual, mental, emotional,
						etc...), unity within the team, and genuine hearts to serve, seek, and
						worship the Lord before and during the missions trip. </p>
					<p> 2. People of Arizona - That their hearts may be open to hear God's
						word that, God's spirit may speak through the trip in words and actions
						to reach the heart of  those living in the reservation. </p>
					<p> 3. Myself - That my love for God and my understanding of His love for
						me would increase through the trip, that I may effectively lead the team
						with the discernment and wisdom that God provides, and finally to be bold
						about the things I speak, knowing God strengthens and guides me. </p>

				<p> Isabella and Johannah will be sharing the gospel to Syrian refugees
					and native university students around the Athens area as well as

				<span class="read-more-target">
					<p> Johannah: I want to go because I have grown to see the reality
						 that life is short and eternity is long, and the only
						worthy investment I can make is in people and their eternities. I
						want to share the treasure of the gospel with people in Greece, I
						want them to experience the love of Christ. Please pray that I may
						grow in dependence on God during this time and experience Matthew
						6:33 and John 15:4 coming alive, that financial constraints or fears
						may not keep me from doubting that God is my perfect provider, that
						I may grow to better know and understand God's heart for people and
						vision for my life through this trip, that I may be challenged to
						have a sense of urgency toward the reality of heaven and hell. </p>
					<p> Isabella: I hope to help stir some spiritual conversations with the
						people I meet and better understand the Greek culture and the overall
						climate towards the Syrian refugees. Plainly, I am scared.
						I have never taken this leap of faith in my Christian life before. </p>

			<h4> Briana </h4>
			<p> Dublin, Ireland </p>
			<p> Mar 25, 2017 - Apr 1, 2017 </p>
			<p> In Ireland, we will be planning outreach strategies with local
				missionaries and going out to various campuses to share the gospel
				with fellow college students. I am so passionate about the hearts of
				the Irish students because of an unfortunate trend in society where a
				lot of students know facts about Christianity, but have been let down
				by the church or have false ideas of who God is. This story parallels
				my great grandmother's story, and I saw God redeem her life, so I cannot
				wait to see what God will do in Ireland! </p>
			<p> Please pray that students in Ireland can be exposed to the truth about
				God through the support of local ministries, as well as Cru. </p>
