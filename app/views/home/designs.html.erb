				<p>As the things of this world pass away, let us place our identites in

				<h4> Lion T-Shirt </h4>
				<p>The Lion of Judah, who is simultaneously gentle and bold, abundantly
					gracious, and perfectly righteous - this is our God, who has complete
					dominion, yet draws us near to Him to crown us as His own.</p>

				<h4> Mountains Baseball Cap </h4>
				<p>This mountain reminds us of God's faithful power in the midst of our
					biggest trials. It's not about what we can do, but what He can do 
					with what little faith that we offer up to Him.</p>

				<h4> YHWH Classic Sweater </h4>
				<p>For our first product, we wanted to establish our hope for YHWH
					Apparel: to proclaim the name of God. From beginning to the end, this is
					about our God. He is more than enough.</p>
				<p>Yahweh, the Hebrew name of God, translates to "I am who I am"
					(Exodus 3:14). We proclaim His holy name because He first beckoned us
					and He calls us His children.</p>
				<p>Don't simply wear this name on your chest. Take up your identity as a
					child of God. Wear it on your heart. Convey it in your words and actions.</p>
			 	<p>You are wearing the name of the Most High King. What will you say?
					What will you do?</p>
