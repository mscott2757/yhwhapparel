			<h4> Identity Coach's Jacket </h4>
			<p>As the things of this world pass away, let us place our identites in
				the One who never fades. Know what you are. Know who are. Know whose you
				 are. You are defined by the maker.</p>

			<h4> Lion T-Shirt </h4>
			<p>The Lion of Judah, who is simultaneously gentle and bold, abundantly
				gracious and perfectly righteous - this is our God, who has complete
				dominion, yet draws us near to crown us as His own.</p>

			<h4> Mountains Baseball Cap </h4>
			<p>This mountain reminds us of God's faithful power in the midst of our
				biggest trials. It's not about what we can do, but what He can do with
				with what little faith that we offer up to Him.</p>

			<h4> YHWH Sweater </h4>
			<p>For our first product, we wanted to establish our hope for YHWH
				Apparel: to proclaim the name of God. From beginning to the end, this is
				about our God. He is more than enough.</p>
			<p>Yahweh, the Hebrew name of God, translates to "I am who I am"
				(Exodus 3:14). We proclaim His holy name because He first beckoned us
				and He calls us His children.</p>
			<p>Don't simply wear this name on your chest. Take up your identity as a
				child of God. Wear it on your heart. Convey it in your words and actions.</p>
		 	<p>You are wearing the name of the Most High King. What will you say?
				What will you do?</p>
